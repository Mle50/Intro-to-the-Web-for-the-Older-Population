								<p>First, how to enter your Email
									<ol>
										<li>If you’re on a computer, go to your browser and type in the name of your email service provider (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
											<ul>
												<li> If on mobile, search for the application of your email service provider </li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li> Enter your email address and password into the required text boxes. If your login is saved, you can skip this step </li>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/email password.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li> You should now be able to access all of your emails! </li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to send an email
									<ol>
										<li> While inside your gmail/yahoo/etc, look for a button on your screen that says “Compose”. It will usually have a pen/pencil as the icon </li>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Compose.png" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Email main.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li> On the “to” line, which is at the top of the page, enter the email address of the person you send the email to </li>
										<li> On the “subject” line, write whatever the email is going to be about. Don’t make this section more than a sentence long </li>
										<li> Now, the blank space under the subject line is where you will be writing the body of your email. You can write anything you want in there, but make sure it’s what you really want to say before sending </li>
										<li> At the bottom of the page, there should be a little button labeled “Send”. Once you finish writing the body of your email, click/tap that button, and your email is off to the recipient </li>
										<li> You’ve now sent the email! Now you can sit back and wait for a response </li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to reply to an email
									<ol>
										<li> Click on the email you want to reply to </li>
										<li> Once you do, at the top right of your screen, there should be an icon that looks like a “left turn” sign
											<ul>
												<li>  It’s an arrow with a 90 degree angle to the left </li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Reply.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li> Click on that icon </li>
										<li> Write the body of your email like you would normally 
											<ul>
												<li> You don’t need to add a recipient like last time. The reply feature automatically sets the recipient to the sender of the original email! </li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li> Click the send button once again, and you’ve now replied to an email! </li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to forward an email
									<ol>
										<li> Again, click on the email that you would like to forward </li>
										<li> Look for an icon with three dots in a row, vertically. Click on that icon </li>
										<li> An icon that says “forward” should pop up
											<ul>
												<li> It has an arrow pointing to the RIGHT on a 90 degree angle </li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Forward.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li> On the “to” line, enter the email address of the recipient, like you would when sending an email </li>
										<li> You can add text above the forwarded email if you so choose </li>
										<li> Hit the send button, and you’re done! </li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to delete an email
									<ol>
										<li> Hover your mouse over the email you want to delete (Don’t click it)
											<ul>
												<li> On mobile, press and hold the email you want to delete </li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li> Look for an icon that looks like a trashcan, and press it </li>
										<li> That’s all! You’ve deleted an email </li>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Delete.png" alt="" /></span>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to send an email to multiple people (CC/BCC) 
									<ol>
										<li> Follow the first to steps of sending an email normally </li>
										<li> On the same level as the “to” line, you should see “CC” and “BCC”
											<ul>
												<li> CC - Carbon Copy. When you want to send an email to a group of people </li>
												<li> BCC - Blind Carbon Copy. When you want to send it to a group of people individually/without the other recipients knowing who received it </li>
											</ul>
										<span class="image featured"><img src="images/BCC.png" alt="" /></span>
										<li> Add the email addresses of the other recipients </li>
										<li> Follow steps 3-6 for sending an email as normal </li>
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p> How to avoid scams: </p>
								<p> Scammers can and WILL try to impersonate real companies to attain your private information. Here we outline some ways to avoid them. </p>
								<ol>
									<li> Check the email carefully
										<ul> 
											<li> Companies will usually use their domain name for their email address (Customerservice@amazon.com for example) </li>
											<li> A scammer will likely use something similar, that looks enough like the real thing at first glance (Amaz0nServices@gmail.com as another example) </li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li> Be wary of coupon and discount messages
										<ul>
											<li> Alongside checking the email address, be wary before clicking on any links to discounts or coupons </li>
											<li> They have a high likelihood of containing some sort of malware that could do significant harm to your device </li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li> Contact the company in question
										<ul>
											<li> If you’re unsure about whether an email is a scam or not, and it’s something important like an outstanding charge, the best course of action is to contact the company </li>
											<li> Go to your browser and look up the company’s customer service phone number </li>
											<li> They can check if that charge is in-fact real, and you can proceed from there </li.
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
