Intro to the Web for the Older Generation by Morgan, Paige, and Nick

Intro to the Web for the Older Population is a poject focused on helping older people with navigating the confusing
world of modern electronics. Many senior citizens, who have not grown up around modern technology, struggle to use or 
understand it. Simply due to a lack of knowledge, they have an increased risk of scammers and phishing attempts stealing their 
information. They also may feel isolated from their younger family members, who all likely communicate using modern technology.

Our group is developing a training manual to assist these senior citizens in navigating modern tech, allowing them to stay safer 
and connect more easily with the people around them. We detail 4 different kinds of technologies, the basics of how to use them, 
and how these citizens can spot and avoid any scamming attempts
